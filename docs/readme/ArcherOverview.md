    (title Archer Test Framework Overview)
)
) -->

Archer is a modern, idiomatic F# test framework designed for clarity, composability, and expressiveness. It enables you to write highly readable tests with minimal boilerplate, leveraging F#'s language features for a natural test authoring experience.

<!-- (dl (# Key Features)) -->

- **Descriptive Test Names**: Test names are automatically inferred from the identifier, allowing for natural language descriptions.
- **Composable Features**: Organize tests into features and sub-features for clear structure and reuse.
- **Flexible Setup/Teardown**: Support for setup and teardown logic at any feature or sub-feature level.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Easily define tests that run over sequences of data.
- **Tagging and Filtering**: Use tags to categorize and filter tests.
- **Ignore Support**: Temporarily skip tests or features with a single keyword.

<!-- (dl (# Basic Example)) -->
```fsharp
let feature = FeatureBuilder.NewFeature "Math Feature"

let ``Addition should work`` =
    feature.Test (fun _ ->
        let result = 2 + 2
        if result = 4 then TestSuccess else TestFailure "Addition failed"
    )
```

<!-- (dl (# Organizing Tests)) -->
- Use `FeatureBuilder.NewFeature` to define a feature.
- Use `Sub.Feature` to create sub-features under a parent feature.
- Assign tests to identifiers for automatic naming.


<!-- (dl (# Setup and Teardown)) -->

Setup logic in Archer is run before each test. Instead of relying on global variables, the result of the setup function is passed directly to the test as a parameter. This makes tests more predictable and easier to reason about.

```fsharp
let feature = FeatureBuilder.NewFeature (
    Setup (fun () -> Ok (setupValue)),
    Teardown (fun setupValue -> Ok ())
)

let ``A test using setup`` =
    feature.Test (fun setupValue ->
        // Use setupValue directly in your test
        TestSuccess
    )
```

<!-- (dl (# Ignoring Tests)) -->
```fsharp
let ``A test to skip`` = feature.Ignore (fun _ -> ())
```

<!-- (dl (# Data-Driven Tests)) -->
```fsharp
let ``Test with data`` =
    feature.Test (
        Data [1; 2; 3],
        TestBody (fun data _ ->
            // Test logic using 'data'
            TestSuccess
        )
    )
```

<!-- (dl (# Tags and Filtering)) -->
```fsharp
let ``A tagged test`` =
    feature.Test (
        TestTags [ Category "Integration" ],
        fun _ -> TestSuccess
    )
```

<!-- (dl (# Getting Started)) -->
1. Define a feature with `FeatureBuilder.NewFeature`.
2. Add tests using the `Test` method, assigning them to identifiers.
3. Use setup, teardown, data, and tags as needed.
4. Run your tests with your preferred test runner.
